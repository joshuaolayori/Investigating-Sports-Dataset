# Investigating-Sports-Dataset
This project is part of the requirements for graduation from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. This repository contains the jupyter notebook (in both ipynb and HTML format), and the files the dataset was pulled from.
The datasets are from an European Soccer database suitable for data analysis. It contains more than 25,000 matches, 10,000 players, 11 European Countries with their lead championship, information on Seasons 2008 to 2016, players' and teams' attributes sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, weekly updates, team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates), betting odds from up to 10 providers, and detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards, etc.) for +10,000 matches. There are more than 300 columns in total. The 'players' table is related to the 'player attributes' table, while the 'team' table is related to the 'team attributes' table.
